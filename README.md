# This website was created to learn HTML/CSS and maybe even eventually Javascript, but that'll probably be later in my time working on it, once I have a good base to start from

I(Adrian Tennies or @TheSillyBoi) meant to create this with @confused99(Calvin), but he gave the project.

 I just gave up and started writing one myself under the same repo, and if he ever comes back to it, I'll change it so there's different pages for each of us, but I don't see a reason right now, as he's fully given up on it.

> If you notice that there's issues in the formatting, or other, please help fix it, this is my first time making a site in
