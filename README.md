# This website was created to learn HTML/CSS and maybe even eventually Javascript, but that'll probably be later in my time working on it, once I have a good base to start from

I(Adrian Tennies or @TheSillyBoi) meant to create this with @confused99(Calvin, that's the reasoning behind the name), but he quit the project.

 I just gave up and started writing one myself under the same repo, and if he ever comes back to it, I'll change it so there's different pages for each of us, but I don't see a reason right now, as he's seemingly fully given up contributing to it.

> If you notice that there's issues in the formatting, or other, please help fix it or atleast mention it, this is my first time making a site without google sites or similar tools. 

*Almost all Icons/Logos were from [Icons8](icons8.com)*

##### Thanks for checking this out,
