    <p class="Paragraphs">I am a 14 year old programmer(As of 2025), and I love Coding, Gaming, and Hanging out with friends!
        As of the time of me last updating this website, I am currently learning Rust, CSS, HTML, and Bash, and I have been programming off and on for about 3 years now.
        If you want to check out anything I've made, you can check out my GitHub page at https://github.com/thesillyboi, or you can see the code for this website at the link in the top bar.

    <p class="Paragraphs">
        I have 2 Cats named Maginos and Natasha, which will be added to the website at a later date.

    <p class="Paragraphs">
        The reasoning behind the naming scheme of this website was an inside joke between me and my friend Calvin(@confused99), where we planned to make a website together, and he couldn't come up with a name, so I tried to name it calvin :skull: but it got automatically changed to calvin-skull- , but he gave up working on it, so I've been working on this alone now.

    I wasn't exactly sure what to put on the website, so I just put random stuff about me, if I get a better idea for what to put here, it may change, but for now, this is what I have. Once again, I am not claiming IP rights to the icons used on other areas of the website, they are from Icons8, and I am not claiming any rights to them, I am just using them for my own personal use. If you want to use them, you can find them at https://icons8.com.
